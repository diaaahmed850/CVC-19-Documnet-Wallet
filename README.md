# CVC'19 Document Wallet

### Youtube demo for application functions and testing can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Ft0mwggR25U) 

## Intro
Document Wallet (Ma7fazti) is a cross-platform application that allow the user to scan different types of documents/cards images, extract information from them, and keep such data on his personal account for later usage.

The application is a participation in [CVC'19 competition](http://ihub.asu.edu.eg/cvc19.html) and it's totally developed by a 4th Year Computer and Systems department team, at Facuty of Engineering Ain Shams University.

The Team name isX-Team and his members are:
- [Diaa Ahmed](https://github.com/diaaahmed850)
- [Abdallah Reda](https://github.com/AbdallahReda)
- [Abdelrahman Yassin](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanYassin)
- [Abdelrahman Mahmoud](https://github.com/AbdulrahmanMahmoud13)

The application developed using Ionic Cross-Platform framework:
- Backend implemented using Python OpenCV library for computer vision and Django Framwork
- Frontend implemented using Ionic Cross-Platform Framewrok

This Github Repo consists of many folders:
- BackEnd            => Contain the Backend Code integrated with apporipate APIs 
- HerokuApp_Version  => Contain the SDK Android version of the real app that can be directly built and run on ANDROID Device , you can read more about it inside the folder's ReadME file
- MobileApp          => Contain the frontend code that responsible for running the application on DevApp localhost
- Prototyping        => Contain jupyter notebooks that responsible for computer vision part of project , you can test each scanning feature and see it's codes 
## Application Features
- A smart SignUP/Login system which allow the user to Sinup/Login with his direct email address or using social login (Facebook and Google+).

- A smart modification system that allow the user to delete/modify the existing data.

- Support scanning important documents like:
    - Egyptian National ID
    - Egyptian Car licence
    - WorldWide Passport
    - English Business cards

## Scanning and Text Extracting
- The scanning process consists of two main steps:
    - Document(card) detection from the image provided to the application using SIFT(scale invariant feature transform) algorithm.
    - In case of national ID,Passport and licence we are providing to the algorithm a reference image for each type of the previous documents in order to be able to detect the document from the given image.this approach consists of the following steps:
        - Providing a reference image to SIFT algorithm.
        - Calculating the matches between the input image and the reference image,then we will be able to get place of the card in the image .
        - Apply four-point transform to get the detected card .
        
    - In case of business card we donâ€™t have a specific reference image so we used another approach to detect the business card from the image which consists from the following steps:
        - Applying canny edge detection to get the Edges in the image.
        - Finding the contours in the edged image.
        - Apply four-point transform to get the detected card .

- Text recognition: in this step we take the detected card from the image and start to apply some enhancements to the detected document,then we cut the region of interests in the detected card that contain the the information we need to in order to recognize the text in it,then provide these ROI(region of interest) to the pytessarct to get the recognized text.

## Brief description about idea and its impact.
- Document Wallet (Ma7fazti) application is used to scan several types of governmental documents such as National ID card , Car License and Passport extracting the sensitive information from it such as ID Number , Car Number , Passport Number and the name of person related to such document ,the application also can extract some dates such as expiry date in passport and so on , the user can modify/delete any scanned document which allowing him to use such information in later use such as online booking for airplane or for manger in a company to save a database of ID numbers of his employments instead of typing all of them manually.
- Also user can scan different types of Business Card to easily and fastly extract the Name of card owner and his Telephone/Mobile number (and email if found) allowing the user to edit the extracted data if he needed and save it as a new contact in his Smartphone Contacts  


## Installation
- Supported OS : Windows10, Linux/UNIX and MacOS
- Required IDEs:
    - Android Studio for SDK android building
    - Xcode for IPA ios buidling (MacOS on Apple device is required)
- Requreid packages and libraries found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/diaaahmed850/Vision19/blob/master/requirements.txt) file
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development
- Open Command/Terminal Window to get your device local address and clone the repo
```
$ ip addr show
$ git clone https://github.com/diaaahmed850/Vision19
$ cd Vision19
```
- Navigate to  BackEnd folder 
```
$ cd BackEnd
```
- Run manage file passing it your ip-address
```
$ python manage.py runserver ip-address:8000
```
- Open Another Terminal Vision19 folder and navigate to MobileApp folder
```
$ cd MobileApp
```
- Install node 
```
$ npm install
```
- Navigate to directory => 'src/app/services' 
```
$ cd src/app/services
```
- Edit scan-services.service file by replacing the existing ip-address to the new one you get from running the BackEnd Server
- Return to the Main directory => 'MobileApp', then Run the application on local server
```
$ ionic serve  -c
```
- Run on [Ionic DevApp](https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/devapp) easily by installing it on your smartphone and openit trying to connect to your running server by following the steps shown inside the DevApp mobile application
